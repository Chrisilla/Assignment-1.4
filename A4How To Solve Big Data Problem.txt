1)  Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail :
	The characteristics of Big data are:

	a)Volume : 
		It refers to the quantity of  data created and stored.
	b)Velocity:
		It refers to the speed in which the data changes in an environment.
	c)Variety:
		It is the type and nature of data.
		• Structured data
		• Unstructured data
		• Semi-structured data
		
	d)Veracity:
		Veracity means trustworthiness of the data and the uncertainity of data.
	e)Value :
		Value  that includes a large volume and variety of data that is easy to access
		 and delivers quality analytics that enables informed decisions. 
		
		
2)  Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data :
	
	The possible solutions to handle Big data are :
		a)Scale up:
			Scale up the computing resources on a node, via parallel processing &
			 faster memory/storage.
		b)Scale out:
			Scale out the computing to distributed nodes
			in a cluster/cloud or at the edge.

3). Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out :

	#Scaling up is also known as concurrent programming while Scaling out is also known as 
	distributed programming.
	# Scaling up is a common method for utilizing multi-core architecture in the context of a 
	single application while Scaling out distributes jobs across machines over the network .
